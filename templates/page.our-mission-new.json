With the brand, we explore, celebrate, and share Palestinian culture in a modern and positive way. We take pride in our dedication towards high-quality, out of the box products, putting months of research and development towards a meaningful creation. All of our apparel is made from unique materials, soft cottons, and hand-sewn with special attention to artisanal detail. In addition, independent inspection agencies further ensure the quality of our products before they are ever even shipped, giving you the peace of mind that you will be satisfied with your product upon delivery. Last, and most importantly, we focus on giving back to communities in Palestine through our meals program and charity projects. The work we do through both channels is what motivates us to grow our brand, and reach as many people as possible.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["56116355-6149-4698-8b5e-2807e264e2ff"],"disabled":true,"settings":{"video":"<iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/339689665?&amp;controls=0&amp;loop=1&amp;muted=1\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"><\/iframe>","video-mobile":"","hero-image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/paliroots7birthday.jpg","mobile-hero-image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/7years.jpg","title":""}},"our_story_text_L7eH9K":{"type":"our-story-text","name":"Our Story Text","settings":{"story_text":"We built this from scratch.
