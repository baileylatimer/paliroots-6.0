Our work primarily focuses on children as they are the future hope for Palestine.<\/p>\n<p>We partnered with the Middle East Children's Alliance (MECA) team to do a 3-month pilot program to research food and nutrient deficiency in four kindergartens in some of the poorest areas of the Gaza Strip. We found that among the 372 children at these kindergartens, 37% were anemic, 4.1% were stunted, 23% were at risk of stunting, 3% were underweight, 20.5% were overweight, and 14.2% were obese.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the pilot program, the results showed a significant improvement in the health of the children. This also increased their desire to attend school more regularly. Their attention and behavior improved as well. We are thrilled to continue this project and seeing the happy faces from the parents, teachers, and children makes us even more excited to continue this beautiful work.

She oversees all aspects of the project including the weekly plans for balanced meals. Each day differ but the meals include foods such as chicken, meatballs, lentils, salads, fresh and cooked vegetables, fresh fruit and, milk.<\/p>\n<p>Four women are in charge of purchasing nutritious, affordable ingredients to prepare the food which is delivered five days a week to these kindergartens. The head cook is Im Wadee, who has experience in a previous nutrition project with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Im Wadee is a mother of 8 children and her work is the only source of income for her family.<\/p>\n<p>Hala, who worked in the pilot project, is the assistant chef. Her work supports her father who is ill, four brothers and a divorced sister with two sons as well.
